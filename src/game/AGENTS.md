# Agent Guidelines for Game Modules

- Keep modifier key lists and builder maps in alphabetical order. When adding new modifiers, insert them alphabetically to preserve predictable UI ordering.
- Place modifier-specific logic inside the corresponding modifier directory/file rather than central overlays.
